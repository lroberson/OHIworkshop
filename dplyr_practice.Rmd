```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## general tips

Keep your raw data raw!
And think about where to store it - on a server?
Shortcut for a code chunk: cmd + alt + i 

```{r load gapminder data}
library(tidyverse)
gapminder <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/data-science-training/master/data/gapminder.csv")
# in long format: vars are cols, obs are rows
head(gapminder)
str(gapminder)
ncol(gapminder)
```
learning the filter function
```{r filter}
filter(gapminder, country == "Mexico", year = 2007)

gapminder %>% filter(country=="Brazil", year >= 1987, year <= 2007) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(lifeExp))
# or
filter(between(year, 1987, 2007))
gapminder %>% filter(country=="Brazil", year >= 1987 & year <= 2007) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(lifeExp))

```
Piping = "and then..."
```{r}
#Shortcut for pipe = cmd + shift + m
gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Asia", year == 2007) %>%
  mutate(pop1000 = pop/1000)
```



```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
