## I'm practicing R markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Shortcut to run chunk: command + alt + i 

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# summary(cars)
```

## ggplot2

Good for everything except raster plots, and maybe spatial polygon plots 

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# pressure is what you're naming that object, and r specifies the language (as opposed to python)
# plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
